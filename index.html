            <h2>Dear Love,</h2>
            <p>From the moment we met, you have brought joy and love into my life. On your birthday, I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. May this year be filled with beautiful moments and endless happiness.
                Today is not only the special day of yours,its mine too.Today,march 29,is the day my world was born,from whose rib I was created.
                I am so lucky and blessed to have you in my life.And am always grateful to Allah for giving me in ur life.

                I ll be always repeating that you are the beautiful answer for my dua.

                I still feel the butterfly moments and lots of happiness you have given to me ,from the day I have met to the present.And I hope it ll continue till the rest of my life.

                I really really miss you,my love.It's bit sad,that I cant be with you on ur special day...But In Sha Allah,we ll make it up on ur next birthday.

                you always made me think,Ya Allah,this is more than I prayed for..
                You  treated me like a princess when I felt useless.
                you treated me like a baby,when I need attention and pampering. 
                you treated me like a friend,when I needed someone to talk to.
                you treated me like a partner,in case of any problems and decision making.

                In short,I cant imagine a life without u...
